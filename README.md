#CybervisionX Project
This web application, CyberVisionX,
using Python Django framework for backend development, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for frontend development.
The Django files lay the groundwork for server-side logic, while the HTML files provide the structure for our web pages.
CSS is used for styling, and JavaScript adds interactivity to the client-side.
The project is now ready for further enhancements and feature additions.
